## What is this?
This is a fork of [GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef).
However, there are two major improvements.

1. Added many heuristic commands for kernel debugging __WITHOUT symboled vmlinux__ (for qemu-system; linux kernel 3.x ~ 6.6.1).
2. Added support for [many architectures](https://github.com/bata24/gef/blob/dev/docs/QEMU-USER-SUPPORTED-ARCH.md) (for qemu-user).

Many other commands have been added and improved. Enjoy!

## Setup

### Install (Ubuntu 22.04 or before)
```bash
# Run with root user (sudo is NOT recommended, since considering debian)
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/install.sh -O- | sh
```

GEF is installed under `/root` to simplify the installation script.
If you want to change the location, please modify accordingly.

### Install (Ubuntu 23.04 or after)
```bash
# Ubuntu 23.04 restricts global installation with pip3, so you need --break-system-packages option.
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/install.sh -O- | sed -e 's/\(pip3 install\)/\1 --break-system-packages/g' | sh
```

### Upgrade
```bash
python3 /root/.gdbinit-gef.py --upgrade
```

### Uninstall
```bash
rm -f /root/.gdbinit-gef.py /root/.gef.rc
sed -i -e '/source \/root\/.gdbinit-gef.py/d' /root/.gdbinit
```

### Dependency
See [install.sh](https://github.com/bata24/gef/blob/dev/install.sh) or
[install-minimal.sh](https://github.com/bata24/gef/blob/dev/install-minimal.sh).

## Supported environment

    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/slub-contains.png)
    * If the chunk of `slub` that the address (object) belongs to is all used, it cannot be displayed with `slub-dump`.

    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/usermodehelper-tracer.png)

### Qemu-user cooperation
* `si`/`ni`: are the wrapper for native `si`/`ni`.
    * On OpenRISC architecture, branch operations don't work well, so use breakpoints to simulate.
    * On Cris architecture, `stepi`/`nexti` commands don't work well, so use breakpoints to simulate.
    * If you want to use native `si`/`ni`, use the full form `stepi`/`nexti`.
* `c`: is the wrapper for native `c`.
    * When connecting to gdb stub of qemu-user or Intel Pin, gdb does not trap SIGINT during `continue`.
    * If you want to trap, you need to issue SIGINT on the qemu-user or pin side, but switching screens is troublesome.
    * This command realizes a pseudo SIGINT trap by trapping SIGINT on the python side and throwing SIGINT back to qemu-user or Intel Pin.
    * It works only local qemu-user or Intel Pin.
    * If you want to use native `c`, use the full form `continue`.

### Heap dump features

        * Download and extract `x86-64--uclibc--stable-2022.08-1.tar.bz2` from https://toolchains.bootlin.com/
        * Add `/PATH/TO/x86_64-buildroot-linux-uclibc/bin` to `$PATH`, then `x86_64-linux-gcc test.c`.
        * Fix interpreter by `patchelf --set-interpreter /PATH/TO/x86_64-buildroot-linux-uclibc/sysroot/lib/ld64-uClibc.so.0 a.out`.

### Other
* The category is introduced in `gef help`.
    * ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bata24/gef/dev/images/gef-help.png)
* Combined into one file (from gef-extra). The followings are moved from gef-extras.
    * `peek-pointers`, `current-stack-frame`, `xref-telescope`, `bytearray`, and `bincompare`.
    * This is because a single file is more attractive than ease of maintenance.
* The system-call table used by `syscall-args` is moved from gef-extras.
    * It was updated up to linux kernel 6.6-rc7 for each architecture.
* Removed some features I don't use.
    * `$`, `ida-interact`, `gef-remote`, `pie`, `pcustom`, `ksymaddr`, `trace-run`, `bufferize`, `output redirect` and `shellcode`.
* Many bugs fix / formatting / made it easy for me to use.
